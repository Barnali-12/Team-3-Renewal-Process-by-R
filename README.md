# Team-3-Renewal-Process-by-R
This code was created for our Stochastic Process Project
There were 4 problem statementsimplemented  here 
Renewal Process - Python and R
       a.  simulate sum of random variables of the different distributions to cross given number  (including and excluding that )
       b. simulate inspection paradox for discrete, Poisson and other continuous distributions
       c. Simulate renewal process given the distribution with parameters e.g. Uniform and the Normal.  Find theoretical values for such runs and also simulate and show values
       d. Visualize renewal process
